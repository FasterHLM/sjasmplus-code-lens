# sjasmplus Code Lens

A Visual Studio Code extension for Z80 assembly written for [sjasmplus](https://github.com/z00m128/sjasmplus), aimed mainly at ZX Spectrum development. It understands your project the way sjasmplus does: modules, local labels, structs, macros, `INCLUDE`s. So reference counts, navigation and renaming are exact, not a text search.

> **Status:** preview. Questions and discussion in the [Telegram chat](https://t.me/sjasmpluscodelens), bug reports and ideas in the [issues](https://github.com/kolnogorov/sjasmplus-code-lens/issues).

## Features

- Syntax highlighting for sjasmplus sources and listing files, also in Markdown code blocks
- Code lenses with the number of references above labels, constants, structs, struct fields, macros and defines
- Go to Definition, Find All References, Rename
- Hover with the comments above a definition
- Completions of labels, local labels, macros, defines, instructions and directives
- Outline view, breadcrumbs, "Go to Symbol in Workspace"
- Problems for labels that are not defined ("Label not found")
- `IFDEF`/`IFNDEF` blocks that are not assembled are dimmed
- Semantic highlighting: code labels, data, constants, structs, fields, macros, defines and modules in their own colors
- Formatting that adapts to the style of each file
- Code folding, "Find Labels with no Reference", a hexadecimal calculator

## Getting started

1. **Open the folder of your project** (File > Open Folder), the folder you run sjasmplus in. The extension indexes all sjasmplus files of the folder.
2. **Check the language.** Files ending in `.asm`, `.a80`, `.z80` and `.inc` open as *sjasmplus*, listings (`.lst`, `.list`, `.lis`) as *sjasmplus listing*. The language is shown on the right of the status bar; click it to change it for a file. Other assembler extensions (DeZog, Z80 Macro-Assembler, ASM Code Lens) claim `.asm` too, and VS Code may give the files to them: then this extension stays silent. It notices that and offers to associate the files with sjasmplus, see [Other assembler extensions](#other-assembler-extensions).
3. **Tell it about your build**, if needed, in `.vscode/settings.json` of the project:

   ```jsonc
   {
       // INCLUDE paths given to sjasmplus with -i / --inc (the project folder is always searched)
       "sjasmplus-code-lens.includePaths": ["lib", "${workspaceFolder}/../common"],
       // Defines given with -D, so IFDEF blocks are evaluated like in your build
       "sjasmplus-code-lens.defines": ["_DEBUG_"],
       // Folders that are not part of the project (old code, other assemblers)
       "sjasmplus-code-lens.excludeFiles": "**/{old,_archive}/**"
   }
   ```

   If you build with `--dirbol`, also set `"sjasmplus-code-lens.dirbol": true`.

That's it: open a source file and the reference counts appear above the labels.

## How to use it

The key bindings are the defaults of VS Code on Windows and Linux.

| What | How |
|---|---|
| See where a label is used | Click the "N references" above it, or Shift+F12 |
| Go to a definition | F12 or Ctrl+click. On `vdp.Cls` a click on `vdp` goes to the module, on `Cls` to the label. On an `INCLUDE` line it opens the file. On a struct instance field (`pos.x`) it shows the instance and the field of the struct. |
| Peek a definition | Alt+F12 |
| Rename a label, struct, field, macro, define or module | F2. Only the part of each name that belongs to the symbol changes: renaming `clear` in module `util` turns `util.clear` into `util.cls` and `util.clear.fast` into `util.cls.fast`. |
| Read the description of a routine | Hover the label: the comment lines above the definition are shown |
| Complete a name | Ctrl+Space. Typing `.` lists the local labels of the current routine, `module.` the labels of the module. |
| Jump within the file | Outline view in the Explorer, breadcrumbs above the editor, or Ctrl+Shift+O |
| Jump to any symbol of the project | Ctrl+T, then type a part of the name |
| See undefined labels | Problems panel (Ctrl+Shift+M) |
| Find dead code | Right-click in the editor > "Find Labels with no Reference". The list appears in the Output panel. |
| Format | Shift+Alt+F for the file, Ctrl+K Ctrl+F for the selection, or `"editor.formatOnSave": true` |
| Fold | The arrows next to the line numbers: labels, comment blocks, `MODULE`, `STRUCT`, `MACRO`, `DUP`/`REPT`, `IF`, `LUA` |
| Block comments | Typing `/*` adds `*/` on the next line. To turn this off: `"[sjasmplus]": { "editor.autoClosingComments": "never" }` |
| Convert numbers | The "Hexadecimal Calculator" view in the Explorer (and in Run and Debug) |
| Assembler in Markdown | Start a code block with ` ```sjasmplus `, ` ```z80 ` or ` ```asm ` (` ```sjasmplus-list ` for listings) |

### Problems ("Label not found")

References to labels that are defined nowhere are reported, like sjasmplus would. To keep this free of false alarms, these are not reported:

- code in `IFDEF`/`IFNDEF` blocks that are not assembled (these are dimmed; set `defines` for the defines of your command line),
- macro arguments and macro bodies, the values of `DEFINE`s, the text of `ASSERT` messages,
- files that no program includes. A program is a main file with `DEVICE`, `OUTPUT` or one of the `SAVE...` directives; other files are fragments, e.g. old code lying around.

### Formatting

The formatter keeps the style of each file instead of imposing one. It only changes whitespace (and the case of keywords if you ask for it); labels stay at the beginning of the line and the code itself never changes.

- Instructions move to the column most lines of the file use. Lines indented deeper are nested code (e.g. the body of an `IF` inside a routine) and keep their offset. Directives written left of the instructions (`MODULE`, `IFDEF`, `DEFINE`, ...) keep their own column.
- Comments after code are aligned within each group of consecutive lines.
- Tabs or spaces and the tab size come from the editor (`editor.insertSpaces`, `editor.tabSize`).
- Lines in block comments, Lua, multi-line struct initializers and lines with `/* */` are left as they are.

All of this can be changed with the `format.` settings below, e.g. a fixed column, lower case keywords or a space after commas.

### Colors

The colors come from your color theme (Ctrl+K Ctrl+T). To change single colors for sjasmplus only, use `editor.tokenColorCustomizations` with scopes below `source.sjasmplus`:

```json
"editor.tokenColorCustomizations": {
    "textMateRules": [
        { "scope": "source.sjasmplus keyword.other.instruction", "settings": { "foreground": "#569CD6" } },
        { "scope": "source.sjasmplus keyword.control.directive", "settings": { "foreground": "#C586C0" } },
        { "scope": "source.sjasmplus support.type.register", "settings": { "foreground": "#4EC9B0" } },
        { "scope": "source.sjasmplus entity.name.function.label", "settings": { "fontStyle": "bold" } }
    ]
}
```

"Developer: Inspect Editor Tokens and Scopes" (Ctrl+Shift+P) shows the scopes and semantic token types under the cursor. Semantic colors (code labels `function`, data `variable`, constants `variable.readonly`, structs `struct`, fields `property`, macros `macro`, defines `macro.readonly`, modules `namespace`) can be changed with `editor.semanticTokenColorCustomizations`, e.g. macros (definitions and calls) in their own color:

```json
"editor.semanticTokenColorCustomizations": {
    "rules": {
        "macro:sjasmplus": { "foreground": "#FF9E3B", "bold": true },
        "macro.readonly:sjasmplus": "#4FC1FF"
    }
}
```

The second rule keeps defines out (they would match `macro` too).

VS Code shows hex numbers like `#4000` or `#FF0000` as colors with a color picker in any file. The extension turns this off for sjasmplus files and listings; to get it back, set `"[sjasmplus]": { "editor.colorDecorators": true }`.

## Other assembler extensions

A file has one language, and only the extensions for that language work on it. Several extensions contribute a language for `.asm` and `.inc`: DeZog and ASM Code Lens (`asm-collection`), Z80 Macro-Assembler (`z80-macroasm`), Z80 Assembly (`z80-asm`). When nothing in the settings decides it, VS Code picks one of them by the extension ids, often not sjasmplus. Settings like `"*.asm": "asm-collection"` (from ASM Code Lens 2.x) send the files elsewhere too.

When a `.asm` file opens in another language, or `files.associations` has such entries, the extension offers to associate the files with sjasmplus, for the workspace or everywhere. You can also run the command "sjasmplus: Check file associations" later, or add the associations by hand:

```json
"files.associations": {
    "*.asm": "sjasmplus",
    "*.inc": "sjasmplus",
    "*.a80": "sjasmplus",
    "*.z80": "sjasmplus",
    "*.lst": "sjasmplus-list"
}
```

Extensions that work on top of a language need sjasmplus added to their settings, e.g. Z80 Assembly meter: `"z80-asm-meter.languageIds": ["sjasmplus"]`. DeZog breakpoints can be set in sjasmplus files and listings: the extension enables breakpoints for its languages.

## How it understands your project

The extension builds a symbol index the way sjasmplus assembles: it starts at the main files (the files that no other file includes), follows `INCLUDE`s with the include paths and gives every symbol its full sjasmplus name:

- `MODULE` prefixes, also when the module is opened in the including file; `@global` labels; `!labels` that don't start a new local scope
- local labels `.loop` belong to the preceding label; `Main.loop` refers to them from elsewhere
- lookup like sjasmplus: first in the current module, then global
- `STRUCT` fields and the fields of struct instances (`pos POINT` defines `pos.x`, references to `pos.x` count for `POINT.x`)
- macros are expanded where they are used: labels inside a macro get the module and local scope of the call site
- temporary labels (`1`, `1_B`, `1_F`, and `1B`/`1F` in branches)
- `DEFINE`, `UNDEFINE`, `IFDEF`/`IFNDEF`, `EQU`, `DEFL`/`=`, and defines and labels created by Lua (`sj.insert_define`, `sj.insert_label`)

## Settings

All settings start with `sjasmplus-code-lens.` and can be set per workspace folder (except the ones marked *user*).

### Project

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `includePaths` | `[]` | Directories searched for `INCLUDE` files, like `-i`/`--inc`. Relative to the workspace folder, `${workspaceFolder}` may be used. The workspace folder itself is always searched. |
| `defines` | `[]` | Defines of the command line (`-D`), e.g. `["_DEBUG_"]`. Used to know which `IFDEF`/`IFNDEF` blocks are assembled. |
| `dirbol` | `false` | Directives at the beginning of a line, like `--dirbol`. |
| `excludeFiles` | `""` | Glob of files to leave out, e.g. `**/{old,_archive}/**`. Worth it for folders with sources of other assemblers: they are indexed too and slow down large workspaces. |

### Features

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `enableCodeLenses` | `true` | Reference counts above the labels. |
| `enableHovering` | `true` | Comments of a definition when hovering. |
| `enableCompletions` | `true` | Completions. |
| `completionsRequiredLength` | `1` | Characters to type before completions are offered (not needed after a `.`). |
| `enableGotoDefinition` | `true` | Go to Definition. |
| `enableFindAllReferences` | `true` | Find All References. |
| `enableRenaming` | `true` | Rename. |
| `enableOutlineView` | `true` | Outline view and breadcrumbs. |
| `enableWorkspaceSymbols` | `true` | "Go to Symbol in Workspace" (Ctrl+T). |
| `workspaceSymbolsRequiredLength` | `2` | Characters to type before workspace symbols are listed. |
| `enableFolding` | `true` | Code folding. |
| `enableFormatting` | `true` | Formatting. |
| `enableSemanticHighlighting` | `true` | Colors from the symbol index. Needs `editor.semanticHighlighting.enabled` (on for most themes). |
| `diagnostics.unresolvedLabels` | `warning` | Severity of "Label not found": `off`, `hint`, `information`, `warning`, `error`. |
| `dimInactiveBlocks` | `true` | Dim `IFDEF`/`IFNDEF` blocks that are not assembled. |
| `enablePushPopMatching` | `true` | *user* Highlight matching `push`/`pop` like brackets. |
| `comments.toggleLineCommentPrefix` | `;` | *user* Prefix for "Toggle Line Comment" (Ctrl+/), e.g. `//`. |

### Formatting

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `format.indentation` | `align` | `align`: statements go to the instruction column, nested code keeps its offset, outdented directives go to the directive column. `keep`: indentation is not changed. |
| `format.instructionColumn` | `0` | 0 = the most frequent column of the file, or a column counted from 0 (24 = three tabs of 8). |
| `format.directiveColumn` | `0` | 0 = the most frequent column of the outdented directives of the file, or a column. |
| `format.case` | `keep` | `lower` / `upper` for instructions, directives, registers, conditions and operator words. Labels, macros and strings are never changed. |
| `format.commaSpace` | `keep` | `none` (`ld a,b`) or `space` (`ld a, b`). The double comma `,,` stays together. |
| `format.operandSpacing` | `keep` | `space` or `tab` between the instruction and its operands. |
| `format.trailingComments` | `align` | `align` comments after code (per group of consecutive lines, or to `format.commentColumn`), or `keep`. |
| `format.commentColumn` | `0` | 0 = per group of lines, or a column counted from 0. |

### Hexadecimal calculator

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `hexCalculator.showInExplorer` | `true` | Show the calculator in the Explorer. |
| `hexCalculator.showInDebug` | `true` | Show the calculator in Run and Debug. |
| `hexCalculator.hexPrefix` | `0x` | *user* Prefix of hex values, e.g. `$` or `#`. |

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| Find Labels with no Reference | Editor context menu. Lists labels, constants, structs, fields and macros that are never used. |
| sjasmplus: Check file associations | Checks `files.associations` and other installed extensions for assembler files that are sent to other languages and offers to fix them. |
| sjasmplus: Associate assembler files with sjasmplus in this workspace | Fixes them for the workspace without asking. |

## Limitations

- Conditions with expressions (`IF`, `IFN`, `IFUSED`) are not evaluated; their blocks count as assembled.
- Labels inside macros are resolved where the macro is used; names glued together by define substitution are not followed.
- Syntax options of the command line (`--syntax=...`) are not known; highlighting follows the sjasmplus defaults.
- Each listing file is indexed on its own.

## Feedback

- **Questions, help, discussion:** the Telegram chat [t.me/sjasmpluscodelens](https://t.me/sjasmpluscodelens)
- **Bugs and feature requests:** [GitHub issues](https://github.com/kolnogorov/sjasmplus-code-lens/issues). For a wrong reference or "Label not found", a few lines of source that show it help the most.

## Development

- `npm ci`, then start "Launch Extension: open a project" in the Run and Debug view (F5). It asks for a sjasmplus project folder and opens it in an Extension Development Host window with this extension loaded.
- `npm test` runs the unit tests of the parser, the symbol index and the formatter.
- `npm run test:integration` runs the providers inside a downloaded VS Code on the project in `tests/integration/fixture`.
- `npm run package` builds the `.vsix` (install it with "Extensions: Install from VSIX..."), `npm run publish` publishes it to the Marketplace.
